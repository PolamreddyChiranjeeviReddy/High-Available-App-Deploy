# ðŸªœ Steps to Succeed in AWS VPC Project

1. Create a VPC with 2 Public and 2 Private subnets across different AZs.
2. Attach an Internet Gateway and update public route table.
3. Create a NAT Gateway for outbound traffic from private subnet.
4. Create a security group for:
   - Bastion: Allow SSH (port 22) from your IP.
   - Private EC2: Allow SSH from Bastion SG, HTTP from ALB SG.
5. Launch Bastion EC2 in public subnet with public IP.
6. Launch Private EC2s via Auto Scaling Group into private subnets.
7. SSH into Bastion EC2 via MobaXterm using `awslogin.pem`.
8. From inside Bastion, SSH into private EC2s using internal IP.
9. On one private EC2:
   - Use `vim index.html` to create a basic HTML page.
   - Run `sudo python3 -m http.server 8000` to host the app.
10. Create an Application Load Balancer (ALB):
    - Listener: Port 80
    - Target Group: Port 8000, attach both private EC2s.
    - Health Check Path: `/`
11. Open the ALB DNS link. You will:
    - Sometimes see the hosted HTML if the request hits configured EC2
    - See error if routed to the empty EC2 (helps test health checks)
