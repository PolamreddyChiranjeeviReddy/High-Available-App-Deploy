# AWS VPC Project Architecture

1. VPC with CIDR: 10.0.0.0/16
2. Two public subnets (one in each AZ)
3. Two private subnets (one in each AZ)
4. Internet Gateway attached to VPC
5. NAT Gateway for private instances' outbound internet access
6. Bastion Host (EC2) in public subnet with SSH access
7. Auto Scaling Group with 2 EC2s in private subnets (no public IP)
8. Application Load Balancer (ALB) in public subnet
9. ALB forwards requests to target group with 2 EC2s
10. Security Groups:
    - Bastion SG: SSH from local IP
    - Private EC2 SG: Allow SSH from Bastion SG and HTTP from ALB SG
11. NACLs configured for subnet-level traffic control
