# General Notes

- Use same `awslogin.pem` for all EC2 access (store securely in D: drive).
- Health checks are critical for proper load balancer routing.
- Ensure port 8000 is open in the EC2 Security Group.
- ALB only routes to healthy instances â€“ unconfigured EC2s will show as unhealthy.
- You can test failover by manually shutting down the active EC2.
- Consider using S3 for scalable hosting in future.
- MobaXterm is used to SSH into the Bastion Host, from there to private instances.

# Common Issues
- 502 Bad Gateway: Check Python server is running, port 8000 allowed, and health checks pass.
- Connection Timeout: Check your security group and instance reachability.
- "Address already in use": Run `sudo lsof -i :8000` to find and kill conflicting processes.
